# Introducing a Temporal Benchmark in Benchbase

These are the slides and my notes for a talk about building
[a temporal benchmark](https://github.com/pjungwir/benchbase/tree/temporal)
in [Benchbase](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase),
especially about comparing different implementations for
[temporal foreign keys in Postgres](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/49/4308/).

They are similar to a talk I gave at [pdxpug in August 2024](https://github.com/pjungwir/benchbase-and-temporal-foreign-keys), but they include some updates and further experiments.

The slides are built on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
You also can get [all the slides as a PDF](slides.pdf),
or [read the slides' Markdown with speaker notes](slides.md).

## Development

You can run the slides locally by saying:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can get a slideshow-able PDF by going to http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf *in Chrome* and printing to a PDF. This is what you want to save as `slides.pdf`.

You can include speaker notes by going to http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf&showNotes=separate-page *in Chrome*, printing to a PDF, then printing the PDF. It uses a custom hack to get separate-page speaker notes with a white background. This is what you want to print before you give the talk.
